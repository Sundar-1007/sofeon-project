            <div>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">There are a number of different ways to analyse evacuation of
                    buildings. Standard fire safety guidance documents typically specify the width of exit routes
                    (such as doors and stairs) based on the number of occupants. Some, more sophisticated
                    documents, such as BS 9999, also incorporate factors such as the occupant characteristics and
                    the fire risk within the building to modify those figures. These techniques are useful, simple
                    approaches that give reasonable results
                    for most buildings.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">However, in certain situations it is necessary to predict the
                    amount of time needed to evacuate a building (in fire engineering, this is referred to as the
                    Required Safe Egress Time or RSET). This can be used in combination with smoke
                    modelling, which can predict the time available before untenable conditions are reached (knows
                    as the Available Safe Egress Time or ASET).</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">The combination of these techniques is often useful in unusual
                    or complex buildings where the standard design guides would be inappropriate or compliance is
                    impractical to achieve. By demonstrating that the evacuation is complete well
                    before untenable conditions occur (i.e. the RSET is shorter than the ASET), Safeon engineers are
                    capable of demonstrating that building designs are safe for occupants.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text mb-3">Safeon have extensive expertise in evacuation modelling,
                    and in combining the results with smoke modelling as part of a fire strategy for almost all
                    types of buildings.

            <div>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Smoke modelling is a technique for simulating the way smoke
                    will behave in the event of a fire. In certain types of building, such as a shopping centre or a
                    building with an atrium, smoke modelling is likely to be required as part
                    of the standard design process. In others, it might be used as part of a fire engineering
                    justification for a building (such as to justify extended travel distances). There are two main
                    types of smoke modelling available, zone
                    smoke modelling and CFD smoke modelling.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Zone smoke modelling is a technique that is based on equations
                    derived from practical experiments. For the building that is being considered, as long as the
                    physical geometry and possible fire scenarios are within the limitations of
                    the fire tests that have been carried out, zone smoke models are a perfectly acceptable way to
                    predict the likely smoke flow rates.
                </p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Zone models have the advantage that they are relatively simple
                    and quick to carry out. However, if the building shape or fire scenario are outside the limits
                    of the experiments that were carried out, zone models cannot be used. They
                    are therefore only useful in certain specific situations, but in those situations they give
                    quick, simple and accurate results.
                </p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">CFD smoke modelling is a very different approach. The basis of
                    the technique is that the space that is to be modelled is built into a computer program, which
                    breaks the space into a large number of individual cells (typically hundreds
                    of thousands). The computer program then uses fundamental laws of physics and fluid flow to
                    analyse the flow of the air and smoke between each cell for the duration of the fire.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">CFD analyses take longer than zone models to set up within the
                    computer simulation, and each analysis can take several days to run, even on high specification
                    computers. However, they can analyse smoke flow in a much wider range of
                    scenarios than are possible by using zone models.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">CFD takes considerable experience to use correctly, and this
                    experience has been built up at Safeon over many years. Some examples of projects where CFD has
                    been employed include large atria spaces, exhibition halls and car parks.</p>

                    modelling in all types of buildings.</p>

                    <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text mb-1">Since water is always present in the pipes supplying
                        the sprinkler heads, these types of sprinkler system are quick to react upon the operation
                        of a sprinkler head in a fire scenario. These are the most common systems and are used
                        in buildings where there is no risk of freezing. Wet systems are required for multi-storey
                        or high-rise buildings and for life safety systems for UK standards.</p>

                        and the water is held back by the control valve outside of the protected area. Should a
                        sprinkler head open in a fire scenario, the drop in air pressure opens the valve
                        and water flows into the pipework and onto the fire. Dry pipe systems are used where wet or
                        alternate systems cannot be used.</p>

                    <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Alternate systems have the pipes full of water for the
                        summer period, then subsequently drained down and filled with air for the winter. This is
                        typically for buildings that are not heated, e.g. underground car parks.</p>

                        water is only let into the pipes when the detector operates (e.g. smoke detectors).
                        Pre-action systems are used where it is not acceptable to have a sprinkler activate unless
                        there is a real threat of fire, i.e. for high value stock or irreplaceable items, for
                        example, archive material, libraries and computer backup systems.</p>

                        industrial risks. They are most commonly used for protecting tank farms where all the

                        reaching a place of safety. Each fire engineering solution is specific to the building, and
                        an assessment may include an analysis of:</p>

                        <li class="primary-text">Smoke detector and sprinkler response times</li>
                        <li class="primary-text">Fire growth rates, smoke production and the time taken for a room
                            to fill with smoke.</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">We often use advanced computer modelling programmes to
                        support our analysis. A fire engineering solution can help our clients to resolve any number
                        of issues, from a minor increase in escape distances to developing the escape strategy

                    <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text mb-1">Traditionally buildings are designed to comply with
                        standard fire codes. Even today this can be the best way to deal with a simple building. For
                        a larger, more complex building the standard codes will usually severely restrict
                        the architects design freedom. It may even result in a standard of safety that is lower than
                        would be achieved using a fire engineering approach.</p>
                    <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text mb-1">Where standard fire code guidance works using a ‘one
                        size fits all’ solution, fire engineering takes account of factors such as human behaviour
                        and the geometry of the specific building to provide a solution tailored to that project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text mb-1">Many of the projects we have worked on over the years
                        could not have been built to the project team’s vision without the use of fire engineering.
                        Our Clients know that the work we carry out will give them a building that is both
                        safe and designed to maximise efficiency and flexibility for use. We are an independent
                        consultancy and our experience and reputation means that the Approving Authorities know that

            <div>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Pressurisation systems are often needed as part of a fire
                    strategy for a building. The most common reason would be to protect a fire-fighting shaft
                    (stair, lobby and lift) but they can also be used for other reasons, such as to compensate
                    for non-compliances in other aspects of the design.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Whilst there are design codes available for the design of
                    pressurisation systems, it is essential that the design be carried out by people who have the
                    relevant experience. One common mistake is to ignore the pressure relief that is
                    needed on the occupied floor levels, without which the pressurisation system may not work
                    correctly.</p>

            <div>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">There are a wide range of fire suppression systems available
                    for use within buildings.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Sprinkler systems are one of the most widely used systems and
                    can be highly effective in controlling or extinguishing fires. This can have major benefits in
                    relation to fire safety, as well as reducing the potential damage to the building
                    in the event of a fire (insurance premiums are also reduced).</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">However, they are expensive to install and there is also the
                    risk of false alarms causing damage (although in practice water damage due to false alarms is
                    rare).
                </p>
                <p class="primary-text mb-3">Other systems are also available such as:</p>
                <ol type="1" class="ms-5">
                    <li class="primary-text">Water mist/fog</li>
                    <li class="primary-text">Gas suppression</li>
                    <li class="primary-text">Oxygen reduction</li>
                    <li class="primary-text">Foam</li>
                    <li class="primary-text m-0">chemical extinguishant</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Each type of system has their own advantages and disadvantages.
                    Before specifying a system it is therefore essential to review what the purpose of the
                    extinguishing system is, what are the priorities and then to identify the most appropriate
                    solution. Fire engineering can sometimes provide an alternative way to design a building that
                    avoids the need for automatic suppression. </p>

                    requirements for the building, recommend the most appropriate fire safety system and assist in

                    always ensure that we are focussing on the specific needs of that particular project. In some
                    cases the client or architect may need support in order to gain approval for a
                    design that doesn't comply with standard fire safety codes. In other situations the focus may
                    simply be to ensure that the building gains statutory approval at the lowest cost.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Whatever the focus, Safeon experts will use our expertise in
                    fire engineering to ensure that the client's objectives are achieved. </p>
                <p class="primary-text mb-3">The fire strategy will typically focus on issues such as</p>
                <ol type="1" class="ms-5">
                    <li class="primary-text">Evacuation routes</li>

                    <li class="primary-text m-0">facilities for fire brigade.</li>
                    <p class="primary-text">The fire strategy would also include details of any fire engineering
                        that had been used, such as <span class="font-700 primary  -text red-color d-content"> smoke
                            modelling,evacuation modelling, structural fire engineering or radiation

                </ol>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Fire strategies can also cover the construction process,
                    showing how the standards of fire safety are to be maintained throughout all stages of the
                    construction. This is particularly important when the work is being carried out while
                    parts of the building are occupied, such as where phased handover is being used, or where the
                    work is being carried out on a partially occupied building. </p>

            <div>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">In most types of buildings it is necessary to ensure that the
                    structure of the building will remain in place for a reasonable period during a fire. That is to
                    protect the people who are evacuating the building as well as to reduce
                    the risk to any fire brigade who may be dealing with the fire. Some types of structure, such as
                    reinforced concrete, inherently achieve a reasonable resistance to fire (although for longer
                    fire durations, increases in reinforcement
                    cover may be required). However, others, such as structural steel, often need to be protected by
                    insulation to prevent the steel heating to the point where it collapses.
                </p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">That insulation can be relatively expensive and can affect the
                    physical appearance of the structure, so it is important to ensure that the insulation is not
                    over-specified.
                </p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Conventionally, in most types of buildings, the amount of fire
                    protection that is required is based on reference to a standard guidance document that states a
                    specific fire resistance period based on the height and type of building.
                    For example, Approved Document B would recommend that the structure supporting a 10m high office
                    building should achieve 60 minutes fire resistance. The fire resistance period refers to a
                    specific duration within a standard fire
                    test furnace (such as BS 476: Part 20) and has no direct relationship to how long the structure
                    would last in a genuine fire (this is a common misconception in the construction industry).</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">This approach is simple, but often results in major
                    over-specification because it treats all structure in the same way irrespective of the fire risk
                    on each element. For example, in some situations structure may be located in very
                    low fire risk locations such as external to the building or in an atrium. Additionally, detailed
                    predictions of actual fire severity often result in much lower fire severities that those
                    required by Approved Document B.</p>
                <p class="tick-vector2 primary-text">Structural fire engineering is a technique where the actual
                    fire severity can be predicted for each location within the building, and calculations carried
                    out of the impact of that fire on each element of structure. This can often
                    result in very significant reductions in the amount of fire protection that is required for the
                    structure, and major cost savings.</p>
